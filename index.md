# Bayesian Tribulations

Welcome to my blog about everything from insidious derivations and their empirical checks to conference experiences.

You can find all the posts in [Blog Posts](blogposts), a (short for now) summary of my work in [Publications](publications).

For smaller news checkout my [front page](https://theogf.github.io/) and to see more about code, you should probably check my [Github page](https://github.com/theogf).
